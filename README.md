BITCOIN VIRTUAL GOLD 2.0 


Coin symbol: BVG


Coin max supply: 21 Million



What got it started?


Bitcoin Virtual Gold was created as a result of failure and persistence to find an improved approach to spreading the control of what determines Bitcoin's best chain. Originally, bitcoinVBR submitted the VBR code as a pull request to the Bitcoin core team. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15067 bitcoinVBR created BitcoinV to give the community a form of Bitcoin that doesn't suffer from mining centraliztion.


After a Recent Abstract in our Community, founding member @wow92 decided to continue the project with a clean start. We are hoping that we will continue the legacy of the creator NullFunctor and grow our community to the fullest. This time With the Help of the community, we are going to decide our members who will have specific tasks with the target of growing Bitcoin Virtual Gold.
